# giNMI - gRPC Network Managment Interface for Rust
This repository contains an implementation of gNMI, an interface to manage and monitor network devices.

This project is work in progress and basically everything still has to be implemented.

**Important**: This project is *not* affiliated with either Google or the [original implementation](https://github.com/openconfig/gnmi/tree/master) in Go.
